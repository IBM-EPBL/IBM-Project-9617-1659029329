## Introduction

When it comes to tracking expenses, you can make your system as simple as collecting receipts and organizing them once a month. 

You might get a little more information from other expense tracking systems (listing them in a spreadsheet, using money management software or even choosing an online application), but all methods have one thing in common: you have to get in the habit of thinking about your expenses. 

It’s very easy to misplace a receipt or forget about any cash you spent. You may even think that a cup of coffee or a trip to the vending machine isn’t worth tracking — although those little expenses can add up amazingly fast. 

There are all sorts of opportunities to throw a kick into your plan to track expenses. You have to get in the habit of doing so, to reduce those lapses, and make sure that the data you’re basing financial decisions on is solid. 

This project will request the clients to add their expenses and in
view of their costs ,wallet status will be refreshed which will be
noticeable to the client.

## Motivation

Many
people in India live on a fixed income, and they find that
towards the end of the month they don’t have sufficient money
to meet their needs. While this problem can arise due to low
salary, invariably it is due to poor money management skills

Using a daily expense tracker can help you keep
track of how much you spend every day and on what. At the end
of the month, we will have a clear picture of where our money is
going

This project will request the clients to add their expenses and in
view of their costs ,wallet status will be refreshed which will be
noticeable to the client
